This is a simple program for Automatic Sprinkler Machine.

To build this, you need several components like :
* 1 Arduino microcontroller (in this program, I use Arduino Uno R3)
* 1 Soil moisture sensor (YL-38 module included)
* 1 Single channel relay
* 1 LED
* 1 220 Ohm resistor
* 1 DC power water pump
* 1 9V DC battery
* 1 Solderless breadboard / protoboard
* 15 Jumper wire

Don't forget to install Arduino IDE to develop your Arduino project.
(optional) You can also install Fritzing to open or make your diagram and schmatic of your program. But, to open .fzz file in this program, installing Fritzing is must.

The diagram of device might be like this :
